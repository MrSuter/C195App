directions for how to run the program:
Login to the application with username "test" and password "test"
The main screen will open with all of the appoinments currently in the database. 
From the main screen you can add appointments, select an appointment to edit, select and appointment to delete, go to the customers screen, go to the reports screen, logout, or exit the program. You can also view the appointments by week or month. 
The customers screen allows you to view, add, and edit customers. 
The reports screen allows you to view three different reports. 

Additional report: The additional report that I chose is to include a schedule for each of the users. This shows the appointments information by user through a combo box and tableview.
